# Codex Usage Stick

Codex Usage Stick is a prototype firmware and local Codex plugin for turning an
M5Stack StickS3 into a small desktop usage monitor.

The StickS3 shows Codex usage over BLE: a GIF pet, a 5-hour usage bar, a 7-day
usage bar, reset countdowns, and live state changes such as `busy`, `idle`,
`completed`, `attention`, `dizzy`, `heart`, and `sleep`.

This project is a personal fork of Anthropic's
[`claude-desktop-buddy`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-desktop-buddy)
reference firmware. The BLE display idea comes from that reference project,
but this fork is focused on Codex, M5Stack StickS3, GIF pets, and a local Codex
usage bridge.

## What It Displays

- GIF pet area.
- `CODEX USAGE` header with `LIVE` or `WAIT`.
- Primary usage window labeled `5h`.
- Secondary usage window labeled `7d`.
- Reset countdowns for both windows.
- Color-coded usage bars:
  - `0-34%`: blue
  - `35-69%`: green
  - `70-100%`: orange

Portrait mode places the pet above the usage bars. Landscape mode places the
pet on the left and usage bars on the right.

## Hardware

Tested target:

```text
M5Stack StickS3 / ESP32-S3
```

## Quick Start

For a full walkthrough, use [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

### 1. Build And Flash Firmware

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openelab-commits/codex-desktop-buddy.git
cd codex-desktop-buddy
pio run -e m5stack-sticks3
pio run -e m5stack-sticks3 -t upload
pio run -e m5stack-sticks3 -t uploadfs
```

### 2. Upload A GIF Character Pack

PlatformIO uploads LittleFS data from `data/`. This repo includes the default
Mao pet at `data/characters/Mao/`, so `uploadfs` installs Mao out of the box.

To upload your own pet folder, place the folder here:

```text
codex-desktop-buddy/data/characters/MyPet/
```

You can create `data/characters/` in Finder and drag the whole `MyPet` folder
into it. Keep only one character folder there when testing; otherwise the
firmware loads the first character directory it finds.

If you prefer Terminal:

```bash
cd codex-desktop-buddy
mkdir -p ./data/characters
rm -rf ./data/characters/MyPet
cp -R /path/to/MyPet ./data/characters/MyPet
pio run -e m5stack-sticks3 -t uploadfs
```

### 3. Install The Codex Plugin

Install Python BLE support:

```bash
python3 -m pip install bleak
```

In Codex, open:

```text
Settings -> Plugins -> Add plugin marketplace
```

Fill the dialog like this:

```text
Source:
openelab-commits/codex-desktop-buddy

Git ref:
main
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/codex-plugin-add-marketplace.jpeg" width="640" alt="Add the Codex Usage Stick plugin marketplace">
</p>

Choose `Codex Usage Stick Local` and add it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/codex-plugin-choose-local.jpeg" width="640" alt="Choose Codex Usage Stick Local in Codex plugins">
</p>

If you publish this under your own fork, use your own GitHub `owner/repo` in
the `Source` field.

Make plugin_hooks = true on bash:

```bash
/Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/codex features list | grep plugin_hooks
```

if it turns out:
```bash
plugin_hooks    under development    true
```
plugin_hooks = true, if not
Enable plugin hooks on bash:

```bash
/Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/codex features enable plugin_hooks
```

CLI fallback:

```bash
/Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/codex plugin marketplace add openelab-commits/codex-desktop-buddy --ref main
```

 Confirm the plugin is enabled:

```bash
grep -n 'codex-usage-stick' ~/.codex/config.toml
```
Normally turn out:
```bash
[plugins."codex-usage-stick@codex-usage-stick-marketplace"]
enabled = true
```

If the plugin does not enable automatically, add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```bash
open -a TextEdit ~/.codex/config.toml
```

add this at the end:

```toml
[plugins."codex-usage-stick@codex-usage-stick-marketplace"]
enabled = true
```

Restart Codex. When Codex asks whether to trust the hook, approve it. The hook
starts a local BLE bridge; it does not send data to an external server.

### 4. Trigger The Bridge

After Codex restarts, submit any prompt. The plugin hook should start the BLE
bridge automatically.

Check hook startup:

```bash
tail -n 20 ~/.codex/codex-usage-bridge/hook.log
```

You should see `UserPromptSubmit`.

Check BLE packets:

```bash
tail -n 40 ~/.codex/codex-usage-bridge/bridge.log
```

A healthy log contains lines like:

```text
sent {"state":"busy","tokens":...,"primary":...,"secondary":...}
```

### 5. Move The Stick To Another Computer

The StickS3 connects over BLE, not Wi-Fi. To move the same StickS3 to another
computer, first stop the bridge on the old computer or quit Codex:

```bash
cd codex-desktop-buddy
python3 plugins/codex-usage-stick/scripts/start_bridge.py --stop
```

Then open Codex on the new computer, install and trust the plugin, and submit
any prompt. The `UserPromptSubmit` hook starts the local BLE bridge and connects
to the StickS3.

If it does not connect, restart the StickS3 and check the new computer's bridge
log:

```bash
tail -n 80 ~/.codex/codex-usage-bridge/bridge.log
```

A StickS3 should be connected to one computer at a time. If the old computer is
still running the bridge, the new computer may see the device but fail to claim
the BLE connection.

## Current Status

This is a working prototype.

Tested:

- M5Stack StickS3 firmware build and upload.
- BLE advertising as `Codex-XXXX`.
- Codex usage packets sent from macOS to StickS3.
- Portrait usage dashboard.
- Landscape usage dashboard.
- Landscape GIF rendering through a small canvas to avoid slow direct LCD
  pixel drawing.
- Local Codex plugin startup on `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit`.
- Hook diagnostics and bridge diagnostics.

Testing:

- Real Codex approval/deny handling from the StickS3 buttons. The display
  bridge is the supported path in this version.
- A polished public pet-generation pipeline. GIF pet creation is still a work
  in progress.

## Packet Format

The bridge sends compact JSON over BLE:

```json
{
  "state": "busy",
  "tokens": 57832,
  "primary": 1,
  "secondary": 16,
  "primary_resets_at": 1778673005,
  "secondary_resets_at": 1779159360,
  "now": 1778671200
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `state` | Pet state: `busy`, `idle`, `completed`, `attention`, `dizzy`, `heart`, or `sleep` |
| `tokens` | Total token usage value read by the bridge |
| `primary` | 5-hour usage percentage |
| `secondary` | 7-day usage percentage |
| `primary_resets_at` | Unix timestamp for primary reset |
| `secondary_resets_at` | Unix timestamp for secondary reset |
| `now` | Sender timestamp |

## GIF Character Pack Format

A character pack is a folder containing `manifest.json` and GIF files.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Mao",
  "states": {
    "sleep": "sleep.gif",
    "idle": ["idle_0.gif", "idle_1.gif"],
    "busy": "busy.gif",
    "attention": "attention.gif",
    "completed": "completed.gif",
    "celebrate": "celebrate.gif",
    "dizzy": "dizzy.gif",
    "heart": "heart.gif"
  }
}
```

Recommended source animation target:

- 144x156 frames.
- Transparent background.
- Consistent character design across all states.
- No text, UI elements, shadows, or complex scenery inside the GIF.
- Keep the pack small enough for LittleFS.

## Troubleshooting

Use the full guide in [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md#troubleshooting).

Common checks:

```bash
python3 plugins/codex-usage-stick/scripts/start_bridge.py --status
tail -n 20 ~/.codex/codex-usage-bridge/hook.log
tail -n 40 ~/.codex/codex-usage-bridge/bridge.log
```

If Codex shows a hook warning about async hooks, update to this version. The
plugin hooks in this repo are synchronous and quickly start a background bridge.

If first-time Bluetooth pairing fails, or the bridge log shows
`Peer removed pairing information`, reset the macOS BLE pairing record:

1. Open macOS `System Settings -> Bluetooth`.
2. Find the `Codex-XXXX` device and choose `Forget This Device`.
3. Turn Mac Bluetooth off and on again.
4. Restart the StickS3.
5. Submit a prompt in Codex to let the plugin reconnect.
